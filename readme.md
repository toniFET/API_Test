# Fake API Project
This is a copy of the projcet used in Udacitys Nanodegree "Front End Web Developer" (4. Web APA and Asaynchronous)

## The Goal
I want to play around with it..

### Terminal
the server.js was started via terminal 

#### File structure
For whatever reason on Github all files are in the same folder (level), but the structure should be as follows:

Folder (API Test)
- Folder (website)
- server.js

--- Folder (website)
    - index.html
    - demo.js
    - readme.md
